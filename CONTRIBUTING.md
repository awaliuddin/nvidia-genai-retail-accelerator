## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update documentation if needed
3. The PR should work with NVIDIA GPUs with appropriate CUDA setup
4. Include benchmarks for performance-critical code if possible
